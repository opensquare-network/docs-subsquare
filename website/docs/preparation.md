This chapter, we will guide you through a complete process of a Vote flow. We assume that the reader already know how to use [Polkadot Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/polkadot%7Bjs%7D-extension/mopnmbcafieddcagagdcbnhejhlodfdd), this tutorial will use it to manage our accounts. If you don't have it, please install and learn about it before starting.

Click the big plus button or select "Create new account" from the small plus icon in the top right. The Polkadot{.js} plugin will then use system randomness to make a new seed for you and display it to you in the form of twelve words.
